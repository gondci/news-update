The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported another harassment of Chinese vessels to Filipino vessels in the vicinity of Bajo de Masinloc in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) on Wednesday morning.

PCG Spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said their vessels and that of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) were on routine maritime patrol in the area when several Chinese vessels swarmed and attacked them with water canons.

At least four Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) ships and two vessels of the People’s Liberation Army Navy Vessels bumped and launched water canon attacks on the Filipino vessels.

A video from National Task Force on West Philippine Sea (NTF_WPS) shows that CCG 3302 bumped and launched water canon attacks on BFAR’s Datu Pagbuaya vessel.

Tarriela said the Chinese vessels also blocked the two PCG vessels, the BRP Teresa Magbanua and BRP Cabra.

Despite the incidents, Tarriela said the Filipino forces continue to do routine maritime patrol to make sure that the rights and interest of the Philippines is protected in the WPS.

Bajo de Masinloc is within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) but the Chinese forces have been in control of the area since 2012.

The Chinese Coast Guard Spokesperson however accused the Philippine forces of entering the area which they claim as part of their territory.
