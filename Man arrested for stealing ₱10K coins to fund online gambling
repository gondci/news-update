A 21-year-old man was arrested in Barangay Lahug, Cebu City for stealing ₱10,000 worth of coins from a “piso net” internet café.

The suspect, identified as Gabriel, was apprehended around 5:00 p.m., hours after the theft occurred at 4:00 a.m. that same day.

According to police, Gabriel confessed to the crime but revealed that the stolen money was no longer with him. He admitted to distributing part of it to friends and using the rest to gamble in an online casino game called “Scatter.”

In an interview with Brigada News FM Cebu, Gabriel explained his actions stemmed from hunger and unemployment. He expressed regret over the theft but justified it as a desperate attempt to cope with his situation.

Gabriel now faces charges of theft, and authorities are urging internet café operators to strengthen security measures to prevent similar incidents.
